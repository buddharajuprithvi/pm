							Alzi Tech: Bridging Legacy Industries with the Digital World

							Recognizing a significant gap between the digital landscape and traditional industries

							Many of our clients were technically inexperienced and hesitant to adopt new systems. 
							Acknowledging this, I focused on building a modular, configurable, and user-friendly platform that could adapt to their 
							workflows without overwhelming them. 
							With a dedicated team of six, we successfully delivered impactful solutions to clients such as SriKanya  and Susrutha—improving 
							their operational efficiency and expanding their digital presence.
							<br />
							The idea of starting Alzi Tech was to address the digital gap in traditional sectors like construction and healthcare.
							Facing low technical literacy and resistance to change, we built a modular, configurable platform designed for ease of use.
							Leading a team of six, we delivered scalable solutions to clients such as SriKanya and Susrutha, 
							improving operational efficiency and accelerating their digital adoption.

									<h3>E-Commerce + ERP Platform for Construction Materials</h3>
									<!-- <p>I led the development of a comprehensive B2B e-commerce and operations platform for Srikanya Steels, focused on solving long-standing inefficiencies in the construction materials supply chain. Customers previously faced challenges such as opaque pricing, manual quotation processes, limited product visibility, and fragmented communication across order, payment, and delivery stages.
										To address these issues, we built a robust, data-driven web platform (www.srikanyasteels.com) that streamlined the entire procurement journey—from product discovery and cart management to dynamic quotation generation, digital order approvals, and dispatch tracking. The platform featured granular filtering for steel and cement products, real-time inventory management, and automated workflows to reduce turnaround time.
										A key differentiator was our analytics-driven back office system, which provided detailed dashboards with order cycle tracking, sales summaries, credit/payment insights, and profit/loss metrics. These insights empowered the business team to make faster, more informed decisions, and significantly improved transparency for customers.
										The result: reduced manual effort, improved operational efficiency, and a scalable foundation for digital procurement in the construction industry.</p> -->

										On the business side, the system catered to diverse roles such as Sales, Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance, HR, and Leadership.

These insights empowered the business team to make faster, data-informed decisions and significantly improved efficiency and transparency. <br /><br />
